Good Practices against COVID include: <br>

1: SOCIAL DISTANCING
Ensure a physical distance of at least 6 feet to reduce the spread.
Stay away from crowded environments, where physical distancing cannot be ensured.

2: WEARING MASKS

-Ensure hand hygiene (thorough washing of hands by soap & water or use an alcohol-based sanitizer), is performed before putting on the mask.

-Place the mask carefully, ensuring it covers the mouth and nose, and tie it securely to minimize any gaps between the face and the mask. 
Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If a used mask is inadvertently touched, use an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water to clean hands.
Replace masks as soon as they become damp with a new clean, dry mask

-Remove the mask using the appropriate technique: do not touch the front of the mask but untie it from behind or from the straps.

-After removal of the used mask, clean hands either using alcohol-based hand rub or use soap and water (if hands are visibly soiled). 

-Do not reuse single-use masks. Discard after each use and dispose them of in a closed bin immediately upon removal.

3: HAND HYGIENE

The WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in healthcare (2009) suggest that hand hygiene is the single most important measure for the prevention of infection. 
Practice frequent hand washing (for at least 40-60 seconds) even when hands are not visibly dirty and use alcohol-based hand sanitizers (for at least 20 seconds). 

-Use appropriate product and technique

-Rub hands for 20–30 seconds, using an alcohol-based hand rub product is preferable, if hands are not visibly soiled 

-Wash hands for 40–60 seconds with soap and running water and dry with a single-use towel, when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with proteinaceous material. 

4: RESPIRATORY HYGIENE

Respiratory hygiene are measures taken by a person to contain respiratory secretions and prevent the transmission of the infection to other persons. Good respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette can reduce the spread of microorganisms into the environment that cause respiratory infections. The following measures are recommended: 
-Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing and/or coughing with a tissue or your sleeve/inside of your elbow, if no tissue is available

-Perform hand hygiene afterwards with alcohol-based hand rub products or water and soap if hands are visibly soiled

-Stay away from others when ill (particularly for health workers to avoid coming to work when ill)

-Avoid introductory shaking hands

-Avoid close contact with people who exhibit symptoms

-Wear a mask if showcasing respiratory symptoms.

5: PROMPT SELF-ISOLATION
All those who get symptoms of COVID-19 should seek medical advice and get promptly isolated at home. This will help to prevent the spread of infection and thereby, save your family members, neighbours and friends from disease.
