Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has spread rapidly throughout the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. 

The pandemic has severely impacted health systems, economic and social progress throughout the world. From a few thousand confirmed COVID-19 cases in January of 2020, cases continue to grow globally. As of 4th December 2020, there have been 1,56,09,614 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,82,570 deaths in India alone.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 

Coronaviruses (CoV) are zoonotic, and are transmitted between animals and humans. Coronaviruses cause diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and more mild illnesses including the common cold. 

The most common signs of infection with COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, and tiredness or fatigue. Most people (~80%) experience mild disease and recover without requiring hospitalization. However, globally, around 20% of people who contract COVID-19 become more seriously ill and have trouble breathing. 

In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even lead to death.
