For purposes of reporting, AEFIs can be classified as minor, severe and serious

What to do if you expirience an AEFI:

Before vaccinating, the vaccinating officer at the session site will counsel you about the possible AEFIs.

Post vaccination, you must stay in the observation area of the vaccinating centre for 30 minutes. This is so that, if you experience any severe or serious AEFI, the medical team at the site can immedietly step up and provide treatment.

Post the observation time, if at any point you experience any severe or serious AEFI, you are advised to contact the nearest health facility or contact your vaccine centre for guidance. If the AEFI requires hospitalisation, you will be transferred to the recognised AEFI treatment centre in your block.

All AEFIs experienced by benefiocieries are closly examined and reported by the state authorities. All efforts are taken to eliminate such events.
